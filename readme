This project was developed using Visual Studio 2022. It would be better if you use the same version.
The VS Studio's in-built SQL server was used for developing the backend part of the software.

--SETTING UP--
Download all the folders.
Add the all folders to the folder Payroll-System-Files.

Open the project in VS Studio and add connection to the mdf file(PayrollDb.mdf) and also make sure to chnage the Connection String appropriately.
